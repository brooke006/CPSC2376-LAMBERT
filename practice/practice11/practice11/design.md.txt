# ðŸŽ² Board Game CafÃ© Inventory System Design

## Program Overview

This is a lightweight system for managing board game lending at a cafÃ©. The goal is to track what games the cafÃ© has, how many are available, who borrowed what, and when itâ€™s due back. Staff should be able to see the full inventory, check out games, and mark them as returned. Simple, organized, and easy to use.
