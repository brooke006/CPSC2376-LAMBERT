# CPSC2376-LAMBERT# Text-Based Vector Operations

## Project Overview
This project is a C++ application designed to demonstrate the effective use of vectors, functions (including copy, reference, const reference), and basic control structures through a menu-based system. It allows users to manipulate a vector of integers dynamically.

## Features
- **Add an Item**: Prompt the user for a number and add it to the vector.
- **Print the Vector**: Display all numbers in the vector.
- **Double the Vector**: Multiply each number in the vector by 2, updating the vector permanently.
- **Calculate the Sum**: Compute and display the sum of all numbers in the vector.
- **Print Multiples**: Ask the user for a number and print all elements that are multiples of that number.
- **Exit**: Terminate the program.

## How to Compile and Run
Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed. Compile and run the application with:
```bash
g++ -o vectorApp main.cpp
./vectorApp
